#8 NODE JS EVENT LOOP

Think of node js as a process that never stops
It's like a flour machine that never stops
You thorw rice - it grinds and give you rice flour
You thorw corn - it grinds and give you corn flour
It keeps running and does job as FIFO
FIFO - First In First Out
The difference is instead of throeing rice or corn
You thorw events to node process
